# BeautifulSoup Challenge

A challenge to practice web-scraping techniques to collect data, as well as sharpening Pandas skills to organize, store, analyze, and visualize data.


## Process

A starter notebook was provided which included basic imports and connecting to the browser. Further blocks provided guiding comments about what next steps need to be performed. I accessed numerous resources while going through the blocks. These resources included screenshots taken during lectures and demonstrations, solved activity files, and Pandas documentation surroung different Pandas functions. 


## Results

The results of the analysis show that month three is the coldest month with an average temperature of -83.31°C. Month eight is the hottest month with an average temperature of -68.38°C. Atmospheric pressure is lowest during month 6 with an average value of 745.05. Atmospheric pressure is the highest during month nine with an average value of 913.31. There are 687 Eartch days in the Martian year.
